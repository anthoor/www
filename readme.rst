What is CSEDL Manager
#####################

CSEDL Manager is a library management software designed exclusively for the management of the department library of Computer Science and Engineering department of Malabar Institute of Technology, Anjarakandy. The purpose behind the creation of this software is to familiarize MVC programming using the amazing framework called CodeIgniter. This is developed as a time pass project by me and should be considered only at that level.

Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

MySQL 5.6 is used for the development. It will run fine for MySQL 5.5 or above.

************
